 Prompt for New Claude Code Session on CIT 270 Project

  I need help finalizing my CIT 270 Coffee Shop HTTPS project. I've successfully deployed a Coffee Shop website to Elastic Beanstalk with the
   following configuration:

  - Application name: coffee-shop
  - Environment name: coffee-shop-env
  - URL: http://coffee-shop-env.eba-h9d9kuyw.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
  - Instance type: t3.small
  - Web server: Apache
  - IMDSv1: Enabled

  However, I'm having issues with the HTTPS implementation. The site loads over HTTP but not HTTPS. I need help with:

  1. Diagnosing why HTTPS isn't working correctly
  2. Manually configuring the Apache server for HTTPS if needed
  3. Setting up valid self-signed certificates
  4. Ensuring HTTP to HTTPS redirection works
  5. Verifying all CIT 270 requirements are met:
    - Elastic Beanstalk deployment
    - HTTPS implementation
    - Apache web server (not Nginx)
    - IMDSv1 enabled
    - t3.small instance type

  I've already set up the basic .ebextensions configurations for HTTPS but may need to SSH into the instance for manual configuration. The
  current state includes a working website over HTTP but HTTPS is not yet functioning properly.

  Please help me troubleshoot the HTTPS setup and ensure all project requirements are fully implemented and verifiable.
